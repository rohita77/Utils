	TimeSeries

		Everything is a time series and works on 'stream' of ticks. 
		Ticks are from in memory cache or server via Websockets. Hence(due to streams), all commponents are Realtime, Event Driven and concurrent by default.

	HTML5 and node.js - 
		Same code on client and server. e.g. computed columns in custom grids (samplers for derived time series) and work on same JSON objects
		Time Series Samplers are there on both Client and Server


	Data
		Market Data is cached in MongoD/Couche DB
		Derived Data /Time Series are cached on the server in mongodb and inmemory cache on the browser


	Client suscribes to time series from Market Data or Time Series Samplers and build its own Time Series Sampler

	Charts, Grids, Widgets run on the browser

	Web Socket connects Server and browser.


	Samplers
		Define computation as sampler - capture ticks from underlying series in a configurable window
		samplers - SMA, Percentile, Percent Change, shift, realize volatility

		Windows - can be rolling windows, or fixed or take into account only trading hours

		Composite time series with underlying time series ticking at different rates. Hence buffering is required.

		cache based on block of time: all data for that time. e.g. data for a complete day.


		live stream slice: multiple worker will bid to update the live stream slice.
		

	UI is all widgets..
		widget needs to implement getWidgetConfig and setWidgetConfig methods. Config is used to maintain the state of all widgets in a users dashboard.
		widgets communicate with each other by brodcasting and handling intents (uncoupled) or interface and bindings e.g. grid to chart

		dashboards: share dashboards with other users, build dashboards from templates.

		summary widgets for alerts
